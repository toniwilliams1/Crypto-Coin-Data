## How It's Made:
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

Why was this stack chosen?
This stack was chosen because in order to run JavaScript on the browser, I neede dto use Node.js. I also used MongoDB as my database to create the CRUD functionality of the forum chat. HTML/CSS, JavaScript are all used on the frontend.
